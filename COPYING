Contents of NUMAL.tar
---------------------

The set of plaintext ASCII files
   numalinx.txt
   newnumal5p1.txt
   newnumal5p2.txt
   newnumal5p3.txt
together contains an update of the index and manual of
the library NUMAL of Algol 60 procedures in numerical mathematics
as published in the Mathematical Centre publication: 
     P.W. Hemker (ed.)[1981]: 
     NUMAL. Numerical Procedures in ALGOL 60. 7 volumes.
     MC Syllabus 47, Mathematical Centre, Amsterdam.

Availability of the book version in the CWI publications repository:
the repository description of the NUMAL index has URL
http://repository.cwi.nl/search/fullrecord.php?publnr=12897
It contains links to the other volumes and to the PDF files with
scanned images of the 7 volumes.

This update differs from the book version in the following respects:
1. The sources (of procedures and examples) have been adapted to a newer
   version of the compiler (Algol 60 version 5) and runtime system
   then available on Control Data mainframes.
2. The file numalinx.txt only contains a new, trimmed introduction and
   the systematic index. The original introduction also describing the
   history of the NUMAL development, and the KWIC index are available
   in the printed version, volume 1.
3. Errors have been corrected.
4. First-column symbols of all lines are printer control characters.

See the introduction of the Index (file numalinx.txt) for details.
